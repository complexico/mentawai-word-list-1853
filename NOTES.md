Before the CLDF conversion using Python, the materials in this repository (inside the [data](https://github.com/complexico/mentawai-word-list-1853/tree/main/data) directory) were processed using R as an RStudio project (the R scripts are in the [codes](https://github.com/complexico/mentawai-word-list-1853/tree/main/codes) directory). The English gloss of the Dutch was generated via the DeepL translator using the [`deeplr` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=deeplr).
