Before the CLDF conversion using Python, the materials in this repository (inside the [data](https://github.com/complexico/mentawai-word-list-1853/tree/main/data) directory) were processed using R as an RStudio project (the R scripts are in the [codes](https://github.com/complexico/mentawai-word-list-1853/tree/main/codes) directory). The English gloss of the Dutch was generated via the DeepL translator using the [`deeplr` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=deeplr).

As a long-time R user, the motivation to produce this repository is as a practice to get started with the [`cldfbench`](https://pypi.org/project/cldfbench/) workflow in Python to implement the Cross-Linguistic Data Format ([CLDF](https://cldf.clld.org)) that I would like to apply and extend to the [Enggano lexical resources project](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW007290%2F1) I have been part of. The other motivation is to (i) document this legacy data in a computer-readable format, (ii) enrich its content following the CLDF standard, and (iii) contribute to an on-going [research on the languages of the Barrier Islands, in Sumatra, Indonesia](https://www.indonesianlanguages.org/home/barrier-islands-languages/), extending the [Enggano language project](https://enggano.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk).
